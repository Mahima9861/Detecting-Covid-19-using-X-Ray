# Detecting-Covid-19-using-X-Ray

This is a Covid-19 Detector, a PyTorch (python3) based implementation, to identify COVID-19 cases from X-Ray images. The model takes as input a chest X-Ray image and outputs the probability scores for 4 classes (NORMAL, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19).
